# Python-Project
Data Science Project
This project consists of a real world full data exploration activity, including exploratory data analysis, merging relational data, data pre- processing and clean-up.
1) I Used Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for performing complex numerical analysis tasks
2) Used Scikit Learn to build machine learning models
3) Produced high quality 2D data visualisations using Matplotlib and R
4) Developed deep learning applications using PyTorch

For this task the csv file ‘Olympic Games.csv’ is used. The file ‘Olympic Games.csv’ contains the medals won by athletes at the Olympic games between 1920 and 2016.
